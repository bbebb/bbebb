### Hello!

My name is Brendan Bebb. I am seeking Data Analyst and Data Engineer positions having completed my Data Science degree at the Univeristy of Michigan. 

I have extensive experience coding with Python, R, SQL, and C++, with some exposure to Java and C#. 

I am currently working on developing a predictive sports modeling algorithm in both Python and R for the NBA to accurately predict the outcomes of regular season and postseason games. Once this is completed, I will look to expand the algorithm to MLB, NHL, and NFL games.

I am looking for a position that accentuates my strong analytical background and also my prolific coding skills.
